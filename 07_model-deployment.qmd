## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Catch rates

### Combined index

### Point Judith Pond

### Potter Pond

### Ninigret Pond

## Water temp

Plot ALE, potentially including a scatterplot of the most recent year of water temp vs. catch.

Descriptive stats comparing most recent year's temp in each pond to mean temp for first ten years of survey. Or comparing to an independent 2000-2010 baseline for each pond.

## Station

Compare ALE for last five years with ALE for everything before that.

### Point Judith Pond

### Potter Pond

### Ninigret Pond

	abstract = {Quasisynoptic seasonal beam trawl surveys for age-0 winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus were conducted in the Navesink River/Sandy Hook Bay estuarine system (NSHES), New Jersey, from 1996 to 1998, to develop spatially explicit models of habitat association. Relationships between environmental parameters and fish distribution were distinctly nonlinear and multivariate. Logistic generalized additive models (GAMs) revealed that the distribution of newly settled flounder ({\textless} 25 mm total length) in spring collections was associated with low temperature and high sediment organic content, placing them in deep, depositional environments. Fish 25 to 55 mm total length were associated with high sediment organics, shallow depth ({\textless} 3 m), and salinity near 20 ppt. The largest age-0 fish (56 to 138 mm) were associated with shallow depths ({\textless} 2 m), temperature near 22°C, and presence of macroalgae. Abundance of prey organisms contributed significantly to the GAM for fish 25 to 55 mm total length, but not for fish {\textgreater} 55 mm. Independent test collections and environmental measurements made at 12 new sites in NSHES during 1999 showed that the GAMs had good predictive capability for juvenile flounder, and new GAMs developed for the test set demonstrated the robustness of the original models. Maps for the probability of capturing fish of particular sizes were produced by integrating GAMs with maps of environmental data in a geographic information system (GIS). These plots revealed 2 important centers of settlement in the system, probably related to hydrographic conditions, and the fact that nursery locations shift rapidly with fish size during the first year of life. It was also apparent that nursery habitats are dynamic—expanding, contracting, and shifting position with changes in key environmental variables.},

	abstract = {It is commonly assumed in surveys that the likelihood of capturing or observing individuals of a given species is constant. Yet evidence is building that catchability, or the likelihood of catching an individual present at a site, can vary. We used 5465 paired trap-video samples collected along the southeast US Atlantic coast in 2015-2018 to estimate trap catchabilities of 6 reef fish species (gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, red porgy Pagrus pagrus, vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens, black sea bass Centropristis striata, red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, white grunt Haemulon plumierii) as the ratio of trap catch to standardized site abundance from corresponding videos. Species-specific trap catchabilities were then related to 2 primary predictor variables: water temperature and percent of the visible bottom consisting of rocky substrate. Water temperature strongly influenced trap catchabilities for all species after standardizing for all other variables. The 4 warm-water species displayed strong positive relationships between catchability and temperature; of these species, the smallest absolute increase in catchability occurred for vermilion snapper (0.0 at {\textasciitilde}14°C to 0.05 at {\textasciitilde}28°C) and the largest occurred for white grunt (0.0 at {\textasciitilde}14°C to 0.49 at {\textasciitilde}28°C). The 2 cooler-water species displayed either a dome-shaped (red porgy) or negative relationship (black sea bass) between catchability and temperature. Furthermore, trap catchabilities for all species declined substantially (42-80\%) as the percent hard bottom of the site increased. Only when catchability is properly accounted for can results be considered unbiased and subsequent management advice be considered accurate.},

squeezing through mesh. The catchability of the study species varied considerably. Long term mobility was positively correlated with ingress and catchability, indicating that more mobile species are more likely to encounter and hence enter traps. No other effects of species-specific characteristics
on catchability were detected. The presence of prey in traps increased the catchability of piscivores by lowering piscivore escapement, and the presence of piscivores in traps decreased the catchability of prey by lowering prey ingress, but the effects were weak in both cases. Catchability
was negatively correlated with the percent reef cover of the substratum and with substratum rugosity, suggesting that traps are more attractive to fish in areas of low habitat complexity. Consistent with this, although fish density was higher at sites with greater habitat complexity, catch
rates were not.},

The catchability of the two larger length‐groups exceeded that of the smallest length‐group in all lakes. Catchability in early and late spring exceeded that in September or October in most lakes; otherwise,
              q
              did not differ among sampling periods. Catchability differed among lakes during September, October, and early‐spring sampling periods but did not differ among lakes in late spring. For 150–199‐mm fish,
              q
              increased with increasing lake surface area during all sampling periods, decreased with increasing shoreline development ratio during all periods, decreased with increasing maximum depth during fall sampling periods, and was unrelated to the percentage of surface area of lakes less than 4.6 m deep. Catchability of the larger length‐groups was unrelated to any of these lake morphometric variables. Catchability of 150–199‐mm black crappies decreased with increasing density during all sampling periods. However, the
              q
              of 200–249‐mm black crappies was density independent during early spring and September, decreased with increasing density in October, and may have been density dependent in late spring. For 250–299‐mm black crappies, the

              in early spring decreased with increasing density, and the

Trap‐net catch per unit effort (CPUE) provides more meaningful data on the relative abundance of 200‐mm and longer black crappies than it does for smaller black crappies. Comparisons of trap‐net CPUE and length‐frequency distributions are most meaningful if trap‐net samples are collected during the same sampling period and within the same lake.},

	abstract = {Larvae from many marine coastal species deploy ecological strategies that promote their arrival to geographically close or distant populations. Some larvae adjust their vertical positions in response to the tidal cycle, which, in combination with coastal features, helps keep them relatively close to their natal population instead of being advected offshore (retention-oriented larvae). However, a few of these larvae are transported away from their natal population and spread further afield. In this study, we aimed to better understand the environmental mechanisms that influence the export of retention-oriented larvae by modelling the transport of tidal larvae and using a species distribution model to predict that export rate. The larval transport model was parametrised with ecological data about the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas and tidal larval behaviour from 2 Irish coastal regions. The simulated dispersal of retention-oriented larvae showed that 55-60\% of larvae were exported from the 2 regions. This export rate decreased to below 40\% if the release occurred in protected and shallow coastal areas. The exportation of larvae occurred relatively early in a larva’s simulated pelagic life (when the larva began to have an active behaviour). When export rate was associated with the coastal features in the 2 Irish regions, wave exposure at the release sites was an important predictor for low (below 20\%) and high (above 90\%) export rates. The study has implications for the management of coastal grounds since export rates of retention-oriented larvae can be predicted based on knowledge of local hydrodynamics. Our approach could be applied to predict the export rate of other coastal larvae with retention-oriented behaviour.},

	abstract = {Two statistical modelling techniques, generalized additive models (GAM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used to analyse relationships between the distributions of 15 freshwater fish species and their environment. GAM and MARS models were fitted individually for each species, and a MARS multiresponse model was fitted in which the distributions of all species were analysed simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using changes in deviance in the fitted models and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calculated using a bootstrap assessment procedure that simulates predictive performance for independent data. Results indicate little difference between the performance of GAM and MARS models, even when MARS models included interaction terms between predictor variables. Results from MARS models are much more easily incorporated into other analyses than those from GAM models. The strong performance of a MARS multiresponse model, particularly for species of low prevalence, suggests that it may have distinct advantages for the analysis of large datasets. Its identification of a parsimonious set of environmental correlates of community composition, coupled with its ability to robustly model species distributions in relation to those variables, can be seen as converging strongly with the purposes of traditional ordination techniques.},

	abstract = {The over-proliferation of phytoplankton has been a public concern for the last several decades. To evaluate the importance of different environmental factors on phytoplankton biomass variations with their complex response relationships in the large eutrophic Lake Okeechobee, the nonlinear methods including Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm were employed. A long-term monitoring dataset of 8 sampling sites ranging from January 1996 to December 2010 was applied to explore the driven factors and response relationships of phytoplankton biomass from the different scales in Lake Okeechobee. Results showed a spatially heterogeneous distribution of phytoplankton biomass there, and the western and southern littoral zones occurred heavier algal blooms than the central pelagic zones. Spearman’s correlation results denoted Chlorophyll a (Chla) was negatively correlated with phosphorus in different scales. In the aspect of temporal variations, phytoplankton biomass appeared a three-peak-two-valley variation trend there, which peaked in 1997, 2003, and 2010, respectively. On the lake-wide scale, the RF model indicated that the inorganic nutrients were the primary predictors of phytoplankton biomass, while underwater light availability factors were followed to play essential roles in the prediction. On the local scale, total nitrogen (TN) was the top predictor in the western near-shore zone, while other zones were nitrate and nitrite (NO23) or phosphate (PO4). GAM results suggested that phytoplankton biomass had positive response to TN increase in both lake-wide and local scales. However, its response to water temperature (WT) appeared spatial heterogeneity. This study provided a new perspective to evaluate the primary predictors of phytoplankton biomass with their response relationships from lake-wide scale and local scale in the large shallow eutrophic lake, and the importance of taking spatial heterogeneity into account for lake water quality management was stressed.},

	abstract = {Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a family of statistical methods where species occurrence/density/richness are combined with environmental predictors to create predictive spatial models of species distribution. However, it often turns out that due to complex multi-level interactions between predictors and the response function, different types of models can detect different numbers of important predictors and also vary in their predictive ability. This is why we decided to explore differences in the predictive power of two most common methods, such as the Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and the Random Forest (RF) on the example of the Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major and the Great Grey Shrike Lanius excubitor, as well as on the taxonomic and functional species richness. For each of the two bird species’ densities and for two measurements of biodiversity, two sets of SDMs were generated: One based on the GAM, and the other on the RF. According to the out-of-bag, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and an independent evaluation, we demonstrated that the GAM is the best method for predicting density of the Great Spotted Woodpecker and taxonomic species richness, whereas the RF has the lowest prediction error for the density of the Great Grey Shrike and functional species richness. It also becomes apparent that the GAM is responsive to taxonomic species richness and species with broad tolerance to environmental factors, i.e. the Great Spotted Woodpecker, while the RF detects more subtle relationships between density and environmental variables, rendering it more suitable for functional species richness and species with a narrow tolerance range to habitats factors, i.e. the Great Grey Shrike. Thus, effective predictive modelling of animal distribution requires considering several different analytical approaches to produce biologically realistic predictions.},

Therefore, this study was designed to explore the comparative performance of linear regression, polynomial regression and generalized additive model (GAM), and assess the important predictors for canopy cover estimation in the dry deciduous forest of West Bengal. We used the Sentinel-2 based individual bands and spectral indices as predictor variables from the different composition of imagery in the growing season (June–September) between 2018 and 2020. Canopy cover of 667 plots were measured using collect earth online (CEO) from high resolution imagery. Univariate and multiple models were fitted and assessed by 10 fold cross-validation. Root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) was used for the evaluation of model performance. The result showed that univariate models using GAM were fitted better followed polynomial regression and linear regression model. SWIR bands and SWIR bands based indices were fitted well than other groups of variables. Individual bands based multiple prediction models performed better followed by NIR, SWIR, atmospheric and red edge indices based multiple prediction models for multiple linear regression, multiple polynomial regression and multiple GAM. Multiple GAM performed better (RMSE = 0.163, R2 = 0.777) than multiple polynomial regression (RMSE = 0.167, R2 = 0.772) and multiple linear regression model (RMSE = 0.182, R2 = 0.721). Although, the difference of performance between multiple polynomial regression model and multiple GAM was negligible. But in respect to prediction range, and overestimation and underestimation multiple GAM was superior to multiple polynomial regression model. The study demonstrates that the potential utility of GAM for canopy cover estimation and GAM can be superior to linear and polynomial regression model using suitable predictor variables.},

Landslide locations were identified and mapped from the interpretation of different data types, including high-resolution satellite images, topographic maps, historical records, and extensive field surveys. In total, 125 landslide locations were mapped using ArcGIS 10.2, and the locations were divided into two groups; training (70 \%) and validating (25 \%), respectively. Eleven layers of landslide-conditioning factors were prepared, including slope aspect, altitude, distance from faults, lithology, plan curvature, profile curvature, rainfall, distance from streams, distance from roads, slope angle, and land use. The relationships between the landslide-conditioning factors and the landslide inventory map were calculated using the mentioned 32 models (RF, BRT, CART, and generalized additive (GAM)). The models’ results were compared with landslide locations, which were not used during the models’ training. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC), including the area under the curve (AUC), was used to assess the accuracy of the models. The success (training data) and prediction (validation data) rate curves were calculated. The results showed that the AUC for success rates are 0.783 (78.3 \%), 0.958 (95.8 \%), 0.816 (81.6 \%), and 0.821 (82.1 \%) for RF, BRT, CART, and GLM models, respectively.

Subsequently, landslide susceptibility maps were divided into four classes, including low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The results revealed that the RF, BRT, CART, and GLM models produced reasonable accuracy in landslide susceptibility mapping.

Evidence of density dependence was identified between the egg and July young-of-the-year stages and high process-error variance was detected throughout the life cycle, suggesting year-class size is not fully determined until age-2. However, the first summer appeared to be a critical life stage for winter flounder, during which high temperatures, hypoxia, and predator abundance contributed to increased mortality rates behind a long-term population decline. Due to its general data requirements, the key-factor analysis method developed here may be applied to other aquatic populations to identify the impacts of external stressors at particular life stages and the degree to which they are compensated by density-dependent processes.},

Taking account of catchability in groundfish survey trawls: implications for estimating demersal fish biomass. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64.Groundfish surveys are a key component of current scientific data monitoring and data-collection activities undertaken in support of fisheries management. Recent requirements to develop and implement an ecosystem approach to management are placing increasing and varied demands on such datasets. Successfully incorporating ecosystem and environmental objectives within fisheries management will, for example, require greater understanding of foodweb trophodynamics, which in turn requires detailed information on the abundance and distribution of fish predators and prey species on spatial scales hitherto rarely considered. However, no trawl gear catches all the fish in its path, so density estimates provided by such trawl samples do not reflect true densities of fish. Catchability in a trawl gear is affected by many factors and varies both between species and between different sized conspecifics, and therefore has the capacity to confound our understanding of predator–prey interactions and of the relative abundance of different species and size classes of fish at any point in time or space. To overcome such problems, estimates of the catchability of each size class of each species sampled in a given survey are required for trawl sample densities to be raised to the actual densities of fish present at each location sampled. Here, we present a method for estimating catchability coefficients for 1-cm size classes of fish species sampled by the Grande Overture Vertical trawl during the third quarter ICES International Bottom Trawl Survey. The catchability coefficients obtained are applied to survey data collected between 1998 and 2004 to examine annual variation in actual abundance of the demersal fish assemblage in the North Sea.},

	abstract = {The northeast US fishing industry and other stakeholders have considerable interest in the quality of bottom trawl survey results because of their importance in the setting of quotas, especially those directly derived from bottom trawl indices measured in catch per area swept by the survey net. Net spread (also referred to as wing spread) impacts catches and thus indices and, for the federal northeast bottom trawl survey, it is correlated with the depth at which a tow is performed. As part of an ongoing partnership between the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Councils, members of the fishing industry, and academics in the region, an experiment to evaluate the impact of wing spread on the catchability of a number of species was conducted in the Fall of 2019 on the F/V Karen Elizabeth. The experiment targeted four species of flatfishes using a twin trawl rigging to collect simultaneous observations of catch and wing spread relative to a controlled optimal net spread. We analyzed these data to estimate the effect of net spread on relative catch efficiency and to evaluate the hypothesis that relative catch efficiency decreases as net spread departs from the optimal configuration. We found that, while the total catch was impacted by net wing spread (catches increased with increasing swept-area), there was no evidence of a wing spread effect on relative catch efficiency for any of the flatfish species. These results suggest that bottom trawl surveys should account for swept-area of individual tows, but that it is not necessary to incorporate species- or length-specific efficiency conversions based on the width of the net.},

	abstract = {Marine organisms that utilize nearshore environments for major components of their life histories are subject to both local-scale forcing such as water quality and estuarine degradation as well as large-scale forcing such as fishing and decadal-scale climate variability. Large-scale forcing has the potential to synchronize the dynamics of subpopulations, while local-level forcing can produce asynchronous subpopulation trends. Summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) and winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) are important commercial and recreational flatfish along the east coast of North America which spend their first year of life in coastal habitats. We found that the two exhibited significant within-species coherence in commercial landings and fisheries-independent surveys across the northeast shelf of the United States, suggesting large-scale external drivers. In laboratory studies, temperature has been found to be an important factor regulating survival during the egg, larva and settlement phases of both species. We reconstructed a 40-year time-series of coastal water temperature for the major spawning and nursery areas to examine changes in the thermally available habitat. Estimates of winter flounder abundance were negatively correlated with the winter water temperature, but not with fishing mortality. Summer flounder abundance, by contrast, was negatively correlated with fishing mortality, but exhibited no link with temperature. In addition, time-varying stock–recruitment relationships indicated that stock productivity declined for winter flounder over time, while summer flounder productivity has varied without a trend. While both species declined in the 1980s and early 1990s due to heavy fishing pressure, the reduction in fishing over the last two decades has led to rebuilding of the summer flounder stock and an expansion of its age structure. Declining productivity due to warming estuarine conditions has kept the winter flounder stock at low levels despite low fishing pressure. The two stocks illustrate the importance of controlling fishing mortality in the management of natural marine resources while also accounting for changes in productivity due to climate variability and change.},

This study examines individual growth rates determined through otolith increment counts of free-living juvenile winter flounder during the 2000 settlement period (April 11–July 7) in Navesink River–Sandy Hook Bay estuary in New Jersey. The fish grew at highly variable rates (mean = 1.02, range = 0.25–1.91 mm/d) and did not demonstrate localized differences in growth. In addition, growth rates determined by changes in length of fish from two local areas (river and bay) were compared in the laboratory. Growth in these fish was highly variable, did not differ with location, but did decline significantly during the settlement period in the river (mean = 0.17 mm/d, range = 0.00–0.54 mm/d) and bay (mean = 0.27 mm/d, range = 0.02–0.61 mm/d). The laboratory observations supported field results of no significant differences between river and bay growth rates. General additive models were used on estuarywide field growth rates to examine their relationship with environmental variables. We found a significant positive linear relationship between growth and average water temperature and negative relationships between growth and temperature range and salinity. Food abundance showed the only curvilinear relationship with growth rate, indicating lower growth at food levels below 50 individuals/m2. Long-term sampling was conducted to examine the effects of these early growth conditions on fall survivors. Through this sampling, it was revealed that winter flounder continued to metamorphose late into the season (July–August). By spawning over several months and having many offspring with variable growth rates, winter flounder may increase the probability of some members surviving the innate variability of a temperate estuary.},

Understanding metapopulation structure and disparate migratory behavior is vital to understanding the species’ dynamics. We used acoustic telemetry to evaluate migratory types, homing behavior, and spawning behavior in adult winter flounder (n = 72) in Mattituck Creek, New York. Telemetry results showed that 17\% of the tagged individuals displayed resident behavior and remained in the creek year-round despite mean summer temperatures reaching 28 °C. Alternatively, the migratory group (∼83\%) started to leave the system when the mean water temperature reached 12 °C. A dominant driver of migration was not indicated; instead, migration out of or into the creek appeared complex and related to date, temperature, lunar cycle, photoperiod, and year. Approximate spawning was estimated to occur as early as November and continued through April based on aggregative behaviors of adults and back-calculations of dates using young-of-the-year otoliths. Our results support the emerging view that winter flounder’s dynamics reflect local life history and population diversity, which are currently unaccounted for in management.},

Previous research has focused on the correlation between temperature and declining stock-productivity, supporting the hypothesis that a warming climate is a primary driver of the species decline. Our objective was to critically investigate several potential drivers of Winter Flounder's regional decline and collapse in the SNE/MA region by evaluating them in relation to management actions, spawning stock biomass (SSB), recruitment, productivity (PROD) and fishing mortality (F). Results indicate that the SNE/MA stock has remained below the 40\% unfished biomass threshold (B40\%) since 1984, and that F was above the maximum sustainable fishing rate (FMSY) for most of the period between 1995 and 2010. We found a negative relationship between F and SSB between 1981 and 2000. Correlative analysis between young-of-the-year PROD and a number of biological and physical parameters resulted in 8 (out of 21) significant relationships. However, after correcting for multiple comparisons only two, the abundance of Striped Bass and Summer Flounder, remained significant. The PROD and recruitment analyses did not indicate strong environmental drivers and suggested recruitment compensation during the early 2000s in some surveys. In summary, we did not find evidence of a global environmental driver, such as temperature, explaining the decline of Winter Flounder. Rather, our analysis indicates that long-term overexploitation and failure of management to control harvest rates preceded and was likely a primary driver in the species decline and lack of recovery. Finally, following decades of overfishing, attempts to rebuild the Winter Flounder fishery likely will require a longer-term commitment than management has shown to date.},

This complicates the examination of the potential role of flatfish in the ‘marine fish event horizon’, an economic shift in human exploitation from freshwater to marine fish species during the 10–11th centuries CE around the southern North Sea. This study represents the first multi-disciplinary investigation of flatfish remains to make species-specific interpretations of flatfish exploitation. Peptide mass fingerprinting and multi-isotope analysis of carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N) and sulphur (δ34S) was performed on collagen from 356 archaeological flatfish and 120 comparative archaeological marine or freshwater species to explore the catch habitat of individual flatfish species between 600 and 1600 CE from the North Sea area. European flounder show signals reflecting both freshwater and marine environments, while other flatfish show only those of marine habitats. A subtle shift towards more marine exploitation towards the end of the period is identified, corresponding to the observed transition in targeted species from flounder to plaice throughout the medieval period. Sites show slight differences in δ13C and δ34S within the same species, related to the local environments. Remarkable is the high abundance of marine plaice and flounder during the early medieval period, which shows clear marine or coastal exploitation of flatfish early on, well before the previously accepted onset of the marine fish event horizon. This indicates a gradual shift from coastal to open marine fish exploitation over the medieval period.},

Using species distribution models to estimate abundance and biomass, we determined body size in weight for all modeled species. We demonstrate a tendency for increased abundance and biomass and a concomitant decline in body size over time. An analysis of length frequency data supports this assertion. There was no trend in the combined anthropogenic removals from the ecosystem, i.e. catches, suggesting a limited role of fisheries in influencing these changes. The changes in the fish and macroinvertebrate communities are consistent with the hypothesis of a tropicalization of this ecosystem, where the ecosystem experiences a change in diversity, abundance, biomass, and the size of individuals consistent with lower latitudes. The changes in how productivity is expressed in the ecosystem factors into how human populations relate to it; in a practical sense, change in body size will likely influence the strategies and efficiencies of harvest procedures and the industries built to support them.},

	abstract = {Random forest classification is a popular machine learning method for developing prediction models in many research settings. Often in prediction modeling, a goal is to reduce the number of variables needed to obtain a prediction in order to reduce the burden of data collection and improve efficiency. Several variable selection methods exist for the setting of random forest classification; however, there is a paucity of literature to guide users as to which method may be preferable for different types of datasets. Using 311 classification datasets freely available online, we evaluate the prediction error rates, number of variables, computation times and area under the receiver operating curve for many random forest variable selection methods. We compare random forest variable selection methods for different types of datasets (datasets with binary outcomes, datasets with many predictors, and datasets with imbalanced outcomes) and for different types of methods (standard random forest versus conditional random forest methods and test based versus performance based methods). Based on our study, the best variable selection methods for most datasets are Jiang’s method and the method implemented in the VSURF R package. For datasets with many predictors, the methods implemented in the R packages varSelRF and Boruta are preferable due to computational efficiency. A significant contribution of this study is the ability to assess different variable selection techniques in the setting of random forest classification in order to identify preferable methods based on applications in expert and intelligent systems.},

	abstract = {A rapid random sampling method was used to relate densities of juvenile winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus to multiple scales of habitat variation in Narragansett Bay and two nearby coastal lagoons in Rhode Island. We used a 1-m beam trawl with attached video camera, continuous global positioning system track overlay, and continuous recording YSI sonde to sample 163 sites in June and July 2002 and 2003. The YSI sonde recorded temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, depth, turbidity, and chlorophyll a throughout the tow, while the video camera recorded other habitat characteristics. Habitat patterns at larger spatial scales were assessed with aerial imagery and charted depth data. We caught 25 species and 977 fish, almost twice as many fish being captured in 2002 (596) as in 2003 (381). Winter flounder was the most common species in both years, comprising 60.2\% of the catch in 2002 and 33.6\% of the catch in 2003. Total fish and winter flounder were three times more abundant in the coastal lagoons than in the bay. We used stepwise multiple regression to develop a general model (all variables, including those affecting catch efficiency) and a habitat model (only habitat variables) describing the relationship between habitat quality and juvenile winter flounder density. The results of the stepwise regression on the general model explained only about 25\% of the variability in catch, but they suggested that winter flounder densities were higher at sites in coves and that densities increased with human population density, greater percentages of algal cover, and higher percentages of mud. Densities were negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a. In the habitat model (r2 = 0.16), densities were higher in coves, at sites with marsh or beach edges, and at sites with human disturbance. Similar to the general model, densities increased with algal cover and decreased with dissolved oxygen. At larger spatial scales, shorelines dominated by beaches and habitat diversity (as calculated by Simpson's diversity index) were positively correlated with higher juvenile winter flounder densities. Overall, the results suggested that juvenile winter flounder were most abundant in coves and upper estuaries. We conclude that these areas may provide beneficial nursery habitat for winter flounder despite apparent human disturbance.},

Growth rates of both species were generally reduced as DO decreased, particularly at DO levels of 50 to 70\% air saturation, and as temperature increased. Summer flounder were more tolerant of low DO than were winter flounder at both 20 and 25°C. At these temperatures, summer flounder growth was reduced by {\textasciitilde}25\% (compared to growth at normoxia [7.0 mg O2 l–1]) at 3.5 mg O2 l–1 and by 50 to 60\% at 2.0 mg O2 l–1. In contrast, growth of winter flounder at 20°C was reduced by {\textasciitilde}50\% at both 3.5 and 5.0 mg O2 l–1, and growth was zero at 2.0 mg O2 l–1. At 25°C, winter flounder grew poorly in all DO treatments and lost weight at 2.0 mg O2 l–1. Summer flounder were also tested at 30°C. Growth was significantly reduced even at 5.0 mg O2 l–1, and was reduced by {\textasciitilde}90\% at 2.0 mg O2 l–1. A significant relationship between feeding rate and growth suggested reduced consumption to be a major cause of growth limitation under hypoxia. There was no evidence of growth acclimation for either species after 7 to 14 d exposure to hypoxia. The effect of hypoxia on growth of summer flounder was reduced at lower salinity (15 vs. 25‰) and was unaffected by the presence of a sand substrate. Similarity between modeled growth under hypoxic conditions, based on our laboratory results, and observed growth of summer flounder in a hypoxic estuarine tributary suggests growth limitation in the wild. These laboratory and field results demonstrate that even moderate hypoxia can adversely affect growth rates, and thus the quality of estuarine nursery habitats for juvenile flatfishes.},

	abstract = {The random forest (RF) model is a powerful machine learning technique that has been increasingly used for species distribution modeling (SDM) by ecologists and fisheries scientists given various threats to marine habitats and biodiversity. However, the observations for model training are often constrained by limited surveys and financial resources. Under these circumstances, identifying the appropriate sample size for modeling is important for successful predictions. In addition, species with different biological characteristics present various challenges for SDM, which needs to be considered when evaluating model performance. We built and evaluated RF models for 21 marine demersal species using catch data and environmental variables collected during a bottom trawl survey in the coastal waters of Shandong Peninsula, China. The predictive performances of the RF models were evaluated for eight sample sizes using cross validation, in which a range of 10–80 sample sites were used to train the model. The resulting predictive performance was examined for a range of biological and behavioral traits. For most species, the predictive performance of the RF model was substantially improved when the sample size increased from 10 to 30 sites, but less improvement was evident with larger datasets. An ANOVA identified significant influences of migratory behavior, lifespan, body size, feeding mode and prevalence on the model predictability, whereas the effects of trophic level and taxon were insignificant, as were the interactions between the sample size and species traits. The abundance distributions could be better predicted for benthivores, and species with short migratory distances, short lifespans, and small body sizes, and for each species trait, the variation in the relative predictive performances of the trait categorical groups was generally consistent among sample sizes and performance metrics. Our study may contribute to an improved understanding of successful SDM and provide guidance for the application of RF models to predict the abundance distributions of fish species.},

While intertidal areas are not typically selected as locations for long-term monitoring, we compiled data from published literature, theses, and reports that suggest that enhanced warming may be occurring, perhaps at rates three times higher than deeper estuarine waters. Warmer spring waters may be one of the factors influencing biota residing in intertidal regions both in general as well as at our specific sites. We observed greater abundance of fish, and size of Menidia sp., in recent (2010–2012) seine surveys compared to similar collections in 1962. While any linkages are speculative and data are preliminary, taken together they suggest that shallow intertidal portions of estuaries may be important places to look for the effects of climate change.},

We created spatially explicit, dynamic models of marine habitats that can inform stock assessments for 25 commercial species on the US Northeast Shelf. The habitat models integrated substrate and seabed features along with the dynamic properties of the ocean. Changes in climate-mediated habitat can affect the survey results by altering the availability component of catchability. Changes in availability were examined (1980–2014) by combining species distribution models with hindcast ocean models. Three patterns in availability were evident: (1) the availability for most species varied over time with no trend; (2) for a number of estuary-dependent species, availability varied with no trend and then dropped dramatically in 2009 when the federal trawl survey changed vessels; and (3) for a set of mid-depth, non-estuary dependent species, availability showed a continuous decline over time. There were few changes in dynamic habitat as the bottom water temperature did not exhibit a strong trend over the time-period studied, resulting in little climate-attributed changes in catchability. Changes in survey design can also have dramatic impacts on catchability, highlighting the method’s ability to detect both climate driven and survey driven changes in catchability.},

In 2017 and 2018, 45 hydraulic dredge tows were conducted following a long-standing fisheries-independent survey protocol, with the dredge transects inspected on SCUBA to assess dredge catch efficiency. Bull raking and quadrat samples taken on SCUBA were also conducted alongside the transects to compare sampling methods. The average dredge catch efficiency across samples was 0.64 (±0.29 SD). Bottom type was the most significant determinant of dredge catch efficiency, with higher catch efficiency on hard bottom (0.73 efficiency) than on soft bottom (0.48 efficiency). The quadrat and bull rake samples reflected higher catch rates than the dredge, but relationships between relative abundance estimates from the alternate methods and the dredge were either weak or insignificant. Bottom type, sediment classification, depth, and observed abundance were used to model dredge catch efficiencies and predict fisheries-independent abundance indices to more accurate estimates. Applying corrections using a generalized linear model scaled abundances through time, with trends generally the same between time series both with and without the corrections applied. This work provides an example of addressing gear efficiency concerns through diverse collaborations and improving the science and management for a commercially and recreationally significant marine resource.},

	abstract = {Climate change and fishing can have major impacts on the distribution of natural marine resources. Climate change alters the distribution of suitable habitat, forcing organisms to shift their range or attempt to survive under suboptimal conditions. Fishing reduces the abundance of marine populations and truncates their age structure leading to range contractions or shifts. Along the east coast of the United States, there have been major changes in fish populations due to the impacts of fishing and subsequent regulations, as well as changes in the climate. Black sea bass, scup, summer flounder, and winter flounder are important commercial and recreational species, which utilize inshore and offshore waters on the northeast shelf. We examined the distributions of the four species with the Northeast Fisheries Science Center trawl surveys to determine if the along-shelf centres of biomass had changed over time and if the changes were attributed to changes in temperature or fishing pressure through changes in abundance and length structure. Black sea bass, scup, and summer flounder exhibited significant poleward shifts in distributions in at least one season while the Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic Bight stock of winter flounder did not shift. Generalized additive modelling indicated that the changes in the centres of biomass for black sea bass and scup in spring were related to climate, while the change in the distribution of summer flounder was largely attributed to a decrease in fishing pressure and an expansion of the length–age structure. While the changes in ocean temperatures will have major impacts on the distribution of marine taxa, the effects of fishing can be of equivalent magnitude and on a more immediate time scale. It is important for management to take all factors into consideration when developing regulations for natural marine resources.},

Winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) is an important commercial and recreational species that has declined in the southern portion of its range despite reduced exploitation. Laboratory and mesocosm studies suggest that stock productivity is reduced under warmer conditions and that rebuilding to historical levels may not be possible. Our goal was to examine the rebuilding potential of winter flounder in the face of regional warming. We integrated winter temperature into a population model to estimate environmentally driven stock–recruitment parameters and projected the stock into the future under different climate and fishing scenarios. The inclusion of winter temperature had minor impacts on the estimates of current abundance, but provided greater understanding of the drivers of recruitment. Projections that included the environment suggest that rebuilding the stock to historical levels is unlikely. The integration of both fishing and the environment has the potential to provide more realistic expectations of future stock status.},

	abstract = {This study evaluated the relative importance of the Narragansett Bay estuary (RI and MA, USA), and associated tidal rivers and coastal lagoons, as nurseries for juvenile winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, and summer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus. Winter flounder (WF) and summer flounder (SF) abundance and growth were measured from May to October (2009–2013) and served as indicators for the use and quality of shallow-water habitats (water depth {\textless}1.5–3.0 m). These bioindicators were then analyzed with respect to physiochemical conditions to determine the mechanisms underlying intraspecific habitat selection. WF and SF abundances were greatest in late May and June (maximum monthly mean = 4.9 and 0.55 flounder/m2 for WF and SF, respectively) and were significantly higher in the tidal rivers relative to the bay and lagoons. Habitat-related patterns in WF and SF abundance were primarily governed by their preferences for oligohaline (0.1–5 ppt) and mesohaline (6–18 ppt) waters, but also their respective avoidance of hypoxic conditions ({\textless}4 mg DO/L) and warm water temperatures ({\textgreater}25 °C). Flounder habitat usage was also positively related to sediment organic content, which may be due to these substrates having sufficiently high prey densities. WF growth rates (mean = 0.25 ± 0.14 mm/day) were negatively correlated with the abundance of conspecifics, whereas SF growth (mean = 1.39 ± 0.46 mm/day) was positively related to temperature and salinity. Also, contrary to expectations, flounder occupied habitats that offered no ostensible advantage in intraspecific growth rates. WF and SF exposed to low salinities in certain rivers likely experienced increased osmoregulatory costs, thereby reducing energy for somatic growth. Low-salinity habitats, however, may benefit flounder by providing refugia from predation or reduced competition with other estuarine fishes and macroinvertebrates. Examining WF and SF abundance and growth across each species’ broader geographic distribution revealed that southern New England habitats may constitute functionally significant nurseries. These results also indicated that juvenile SF have a geographic range extending further north than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {Catchability, a key parameter in stock assessment, is often considered constant in time and space. However, when fishing with passive gears like traps or gillnets, fish behavior determines the odds of encounter with the fishers and thus catchability. Few studies have presented comprehensive empirical evidence of the link between behavior measured in the wild and catchability from a life-history strategy perspective. Here, a suite of different variables, including environmental cues, physiological states, fish activity, home range and catchability, were modeled using a sinusoidal function to describe their seasonality over the year and the degree of coupling among them in a sedentary coastal fish (Labrus bergylta). All the variables except the home range size showed a significant variation over the year, following a sinusoidal pattern. The models showed a tight match between the seasonality of catchability and fish activity, with high values of both variables occurring in late spring to early summer, when the highest levels of feeding and the period of reproductive inactivity occurred. Lower catchability values were predicted in late autumn to early winter, coinciding with the spawning season and the associated reduced activity. This integrative research shows that the spatio-temporal dimension of fish life-history strategy has a key role in shaping catchability even in highly sedentary species. Time-varying catchability needs to be incorporated into stock assessment models that aim to accurately describe fish population health and to estimate abundance indices.},

Diel catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates are examined from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center bottom trawl surveys conducted during autumn (1963–2009) and spring (1968–2009). Influential environmental variables on survey catchability are identified for Spiny Dogfish life history stages and five pelagic prey species: Butterfish Peprilus triacanthus, Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus, shortfin squid Illex spp., longfin squid Doryteuthis spp., and Atlantic Mackerel Scomber scombrus. Daytime survey catchability was significantly higher than nighttime catchability for most species during autumn and for mature male Spiny Dogfish, shortfin squid, and longfin squid during spring in the NES LME. For most stages and species examined, breakpoint analyses identified significant increases in CPUE in the morning, peak CPUE during the day, and significant declines in CPUE in the late afternoon. Seasonal probabilities of daytime catch were largely driven by solar zenith angle for most species, with stronger trends identified during autumn. Unadjusted CPUE estimates appear to overestimate absolute abundance, with adjustments resulting in reductions in absolute abundance ranging from 41\% for Spiny Dogfish to 91\% for shortfin and longfin squids. These findings have important implications for Spiny Dogfish regarding estimates of population consumption of key pelagic prey species and their ecological footprint within the NES LME.

	abstract = {For both survey and commercial trawls, selection of flatfish species and sizes is strongly influenced by fish behavioral reactions to the ground-gear. Herding begins with initial disturbance, where flatfish are flushed from the sediment by ground-gear. Yet this initial behavioral reaction is poorly understood, especially relative to effects of environmental parameters such as light and temperature. The goal of this study was to examine disturbance and herding behavior in English sole, northern rock sole and Pacific halibut using a simulated trawl footrope, in both light and darkness at 9°C, and additionally, for rock sole, at 2°C. In the light, all species exhibited a disturbance response consistent with the initiation of herding; directed swimming in close proximity to the substrate. This response was diminished in darkness, with fish hopping or slowly rising off the bottom, such that the footrope quickly passed beneath them (precluding herding). Low temperature also influenced rock sole behavior, increasing the likelihood that fish would simply hop off the bottom, rather than initiate herding. These results help lay a behavioral framework for understanding such phenomenon as diel and seasonal variations in flatfish catches and fish size composition, and why diel patterns for survey and commercial trawls often differ. Further, difference in behavior between rock sole and Pacific halibut suggest possible avenues of reducing halibut bycatch at night.},

m2 cages were placed in vegetated and unvegetated habitats and growth rates of individually marked fish were measured in three 10 to 15 d experiments from 4 June to 7 July 1997. Water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and benthic food
were also measured. Stable isotopes of C and N were measured in experimental and wild fish. Growth rates were 0.06 to 0.76 mm d-1 and decreased through the experiments. Growth rates of wild fish (0.19 mm d-1 in Point Judith Pond and
0.21 in Ninigret Pond) were similar to the average of the 2nd and 3rd experiments (0.24 mm d-1). Growth rates were the same in vegetated and unvegetated sites. They were also the same in Point Judith and Ninigret ponds but lower in Green Hill
Pond. An ANCOVA suggested that Green Hill's lower rates were caused by its higher temperatures, particularly during the 3rd experiment. Benthic food was similar in the different ponds, different habitat types, and in cores taken inside and outside
cages. Categories of food consumed by fish were not affected by the presence of vegetation in a cage, although food consumed did differ from pond to pond. Amphipods were the preferred food in all ponds; fish consumed proportionately more amphipods and
fewer polychaetes in Ninigret Pond than in the other ponds. Values of δ15N in the fish varied with the degree of development in the watershed but not with total nitrogen in the water column. The results of this study
indicate that growth rates of fish can be used as indicators of habitat quality.},

The nitrogen loadings per unit area of the salt ponds are 240–770 mmol N per m2 per year. Instead of the high nutrient concentrations, increased phytoplankton biomass and turbidity, leading to eventual loss of benthic macrophytes described for such systems as the Chesapeake, Patuxent and Appalachicola Bay, nutrient enrichment of the Rhode Island lagoons has led to increased growth of marine macroalgae. The increased macroalgal growth appears to alter the benthic habitat and a shift from a grazing to detrital food chain appears to be impacting important shellfisheries. As more extensive areas of organic sediments develop, geochemical cycling changes, resulting in higher rates of nitrogen remineralization and accelerated eutrophication. The major sources of nitrogen inputs to the salt ponds have been identified and a series of management initiatives have been designed to limit inputs from present and potential development within the watersheds of the lagoons.},

	abstract = {The southern New England – mid-Atlantic (SNE–MA) stock of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) collapsed in the 1990s without discernable recovery to date. Owing to the lack of recovery, consideration of population subcomponents, which are currently ignored in fisheries stock structure definitions, may be necessary for rebuilding. We used the otolith chemistry tracer manganese–calcium ratios (Mn/Ca) to estimate inshore- versus ocean-nursery contributions of 77.3\%/22.7\% in SNE–MA, 15.7\%/84.3\% in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), and 60.0\%/40.0\% in Georges Bank (GB). In addition, we used strontium–calcium ratios (Sr/Ca) to estimate migratory- and resident-contingent membership of nursery-classified fish. Across all stocks, 30.2\% of fish were classified as bay residents, 25.2\% as bay migrants, 25.8\% as ocean residents, and 18.8\% as ocean migrants. Finally, model selection indicated that both nursery-specific and contingent-specific growth models were more appropriate than a common model. Nursery-specific models exhibited increasing deviations in length with age. Contingent-specific model reflected moderate differences at the youngest ages but convergence at older ages. These findings are informative for the population structure and migration ecology of winter flounder; however, simulation is required to determine whether partial migration and substock structure are necessary inputs for sustainable fisheries management.},

However, the abiotic drivers of post-settlement mortality and growth are difficult to disentangle from the effects of predation. Young-of-the-year (YOY) winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus, collected from Shinnecock Bay, NY (USA), were kept in predator-exclusion cages from May through August in 2016 and 2017, with simultaneous recording of dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity at each caging site. Daily mortality rates in cages were 7 to 5.9 times less than mortality estimated for wild fish from the same area. We modeled the effect of 9 time-varying environmental variables, as well as the effect of cage location and depth, on survival and growth of caged fish using a Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates. The site that had the best survival in 2016 was not the site that had the best growth within that year, highlighting the potential for trade-offs between survival and growth. We found evidence that environmental conditions can impose both acute and chronic stress to YOY fish in estuarine environments, as well as potential threshold effects that warrant further exploration. Future monitoring efforts and studies of habitat suitability should take into account the degree and duration of exposure to temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen extremes, not just the average conditions. We argue that risk can more accurately be captured by measuring aspects of the frequency, duration and intensity of both acute and chronic manifestations of environmental stressors, revealing potential thresholds and sublethal effects.},

	abstract = {Measuring the reliance of adult spawning winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus Walbaum) on estuarine habitat is problematic and may require acoustic telemetry. Efforts in various estuaries over several years have been hampered by sporadic results in detection of telemetered fish, possibly due to burial. After confirming that captive winter flounder in ambient temperature flow-through enclosures buried often and sometimes deeply, especially during low temperatures, we analyzed the effect of burial on tag signal (76.8kHz, 5s repeat rate) during periodic visitation of a grid of listening stations, vessel-towed and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) searches, and continuous 3-D tracking through a synchronized multiple-hydrophone positioning array. Controlled tests of tag burial in situ resulted in complete signal loss with burial at all of the tested depths. The difference between tag detection and decoding was demonstrated to be very important. Water column depth during mobile telemetry positively affected reception of tags lying on the sediment surface. Signal strength of tags on fish at liberty as recorded by an AUV-mounted hydrophone was similar during daytime and subsequent nighttime transects, as were mean counts of decoded signals per tag. However, variance was highly skewed with some tags being heard much more often at night, an expected consequence of nighttime emergence from burial, despite windier (noisier conditions) at night. Meter-scale tracking by multi-hydrophone trilateration over periods of days to weeks determined burial by timeline disruption for individual fish. The use of Markov Models, reference tags, and environmental conditions presents an opportunity to correct for biases in tag detection rates due to burial post facto. In addition, telemetry should consider nighttime efforts during the spawning season and continuous mobile (e.g. towed transect) or more frequent listening stations in search grids and closer moored hydrophone spacing than suggested by reference tags. These approaches may be relevant to other flatfishes and other fishes that bury or use benthic shelters.},

Hook-and-line surveys allow for the collection of biological information, but the resultant indices of abundance may be biased. We designed simulations to address concerns around survey design, hook saturation, and competition among species and found that catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined more slowly than population size across all scenarios. This hyperstability was most prominent when fish were found in high-density patches, and these scenarios have median absolute relative error values roughly three to five times greater than those with more even distributions of fish density. Despite hyperstability, the surveys still had statistical power to detect changes in abundance. Interspecific competition for hooks caused bias in survey results when one species was more aggressive than another. Taken together, our results indicate hook-and-line surveys fill a niche in survey methodologies, but their use and interpretation can be challenged by hyperstability and competition among species.},

	abstract = {We developed a new approach for evaluating gillnet catches. A model of a gillnet catch was built to differentiate the effects of gillnet saturation, fish activity and fish escapement from the gillnet catch. The corrected gillnet catch, termed the catchable biomass rate in the text, is the weight of fish that can be caught within an hour by an empty gillnet during a period of unitary fish activity. We also observed the effects of soak time (2, 5, 8, 11 and 13h) and sampling period (August vs. September) on the catch. Our results show that saturation and fish escapement from gillnets are important events occurring during each use, thus violating the assumption of a linear relationship between gillnet catch and fish density. The maximal capacity of a standardized benthic gillnet (45m2 area, 12 mesh sizes that range from 5 to 55mm) was assessed to be 11kg, i.e., 245kg 1000m−2 of gillnet. Sampling time had only a negligible effect on the gillnet catch. We recommend using the catchable biomass rate instead of uncorrected gillnet catches in interpretation of obtained data, especially when the catches are above 3kg per standardized gillnet (i.e., 67kg 1000m−2). We created a conversion table and a slide rule, from which the catchable biomass rates can be determined. We also developed a method for the conversion of catches based on different soak times. Our findings help to better understand the processes underlying gillnet catches and improve the interpretability and reliability of this method in comparing different gears used and assessing fish communities in general.},

However, there have been many indications that this paradigm may not apply to populations in the Gulf of Maine. To understand winter flounder spawning movements and habitat use more clearly, 40 ripe, pre-spawning adult fish were tagged with acoustic transmitters offshore and tracked in 2009 in the western Gulf of Maine. In addition, winter flounder collected by bottom trawl in the offshore study area were tagged with conventional tags, examined to quantify how the reproductive status of the general population changed over time, and released. Peak spawning of winter flounder in Ipswich Bay occurred in late April to early May. Only six fish (16\%) were detected entering estuaries between the end of April and August, indicating that the majority of the tagged fish did not spawn in estuaries but remained in deeper, coastal waters. Surveys made within a New Hampshire estuary when one tagged female was present (May–June) revealed that all captured adults had already spawned and were actively feeding. As of May 2012, conventional tagging returns (395 fish tagged, 5\% return rate) show both long and short movements. Fish have been recaptured approximately 0.6–57.2km from their tagging sites in depths of 2–75m. Days at liberty range from 33 to 453 days, with an average of 171 days. Recaptured fish in the study area in the subsequent year adds to the evidence that winter flounder may display spawning site fidelity. However, relocations of fish well outside of Ipswich Bay suggest mixing of populations of winter flounder is likely. Based on the results of this study, consideration should be given to extending the Essential Fish Habitat for Gulf of Maine winter flounder to include near-shore coastal waters during the spawning season.},

	abstract = {The social structure and reproductive behaviour of the wide-eyed flounder, Bothus podas, was studied in the coastal waters around the Azorean Islands. Both sexes are territorial throughout the year. Adult males defend large territories, which include several smaller female territories. Intraspecific agonistic behaviour was frequent and differed between sexes: males were more aggressive towards other males, while females were only aggressive towards each other and juveniles. During the reproductive season and only at dawn, territorial males court and mate successively with females in their territories, and females seem to show mating fidelity to their dominant male. Such territoriality and mating patterns indicate a haremic social system in the wide-eyed flounder. In order to identify potential factors influencing female mate choice acting on this haremic system, we examined male mating success and some of its potential correlates. We found no evidence for female preference for any of the males' physical or territory characteristics. However, courtship effort was strongly correlated with the total number of attempted and successful spawnings, indicating that females seem to mate preferentially with males that court them more vigorously. Thus, our data suggest that courtship plays an important role in determining male mating success in the wide-eyed flounder and, that it may possibly serve as an honest indicator of male `quality' for female choice.},

	abstract = {The distribution and demographics of a population of Winter Flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus were examined for changes related to habitat quality over a fishery-independent survey period of 29 years, encompassing an 82\% decline in abundance. We tested for spatial and temporal variation in indicators of fitness to determine whether they revealed likely processes that resulted in the observed patterns of habitat use. We also assessed temporal changes in fitness and inferred changes in habitat quality associated with population decline. We focused on the condition of postspawn (resting) mature and immature fish of both sexes during a critical period of spring feeding prior to summer migration. Analysis of variance of individual condition indices (log10[length]–log10[weight] regression residuals) by sex/maturity group and time period identified consistent and significant differences among six survey strata. Highest condition indices were observed for fish that were captured in shallow ({\textless}18-m) mud, sand, and transitional bottom sediment and deep ({\textgreater}18-m) mud areas, collectively classified as high-quality habitat. The proportion of the population that occupied high-quality habitat remained unchanged at approximately 60\% over the time series. As abundance decreased, condition decreased in mature females, increased in immature fish of both sexes, and was mixed in mature males. Additionally, the proportion mature at length shifted significantly upward for both sexes, the back-calculated lengths at ages 2 and 3 increased for mature individuals, and the estimated winter growth declined for age-3 mature and immature females. The results suggested increased competition for prey among mature fish and increased predation pressure on smaller fish. This Winter Flounder population may be responding to an increase in the abundance of competing mid-Atlantic species, which was brought about by increasing water temperature. These second-order effects may have chronically hindered Winter Flounder reproduction and therefore stock rebuilding, especially in areas of low-quality habitat.

The goal of this study was to quantify the ecosystem service benefit of habitat provisioning in Ninigret Pond, RI following oyster restoration. We measured four metrics, abundance, biomass, species richness and diversity, as well as isotopic composition in fish and invertebrates collected seasonally from restored oyster, aquaculture, and bare sediment sites, to examine whether the oyster habitat outperformed the bare sediment habitat. Sampling locations were chosen in Foster’s Cove north and south, Grassy Point, South Sanctuary, and an Aquaculture lease; each had two restored oyster sites and one bare sediment site. Each site was sampled using a box trap, seine net, shrimp trap, and minnow trap. Oyster habitats had significantly greater metrics than did bare sediment habitats in some comparisons from the box trap and seine net samples. Restored oyster sites at South Sanctuary had lower metric values than the other oyster sites. Metrics from the Aquaculture sites were comparable to the Foster’s Cove and Grassy Point restored oyster sites and often outperformed South Sanctuary restored oyster sites. Seasonally, spring and autumn samples tended to have higher abundance and biomass values than summer. Isotopic composition of five species occurring at both restored oyster and bare sediment sites demonstrated some differences in the trophic levels between species but not between habitat types. In Ninigret Pond, fish and invertebrate abundance, biomass, species richness, and diversity benefit from the use of oyster and bare sediment habitats. Coastal zone managers interested in restoring the ecological function of oyster reefs to support fish and invertebrate communities should consider strategically locating restoration projects within the mosaic of structured habitats and monitoring them for selected ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Determining the efficacy of restoration practices is critical for enhancing and rebuilding degraded ecosystems. A fundamental question in marine restoration design is whether to employ active (e.g., using living plants or oysters that form the biogenic habitat) or passive (e.g., restoring the hydrology and sediment materials at the site) restoration strategies. Furthermore, the identity of sources used in restoring biogenic habitats could influence the effectiveness of restoration efforts. We present results from two independent experimental restoration efforts designed to explore the efficacy of these different approaches for the recovery of Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) reef habitat. Conducted from 2015–2020 in Rhode Island, USA, the restoration experiments compared 1) passive (unseeded shell) vs. active (seeded spat on shell) restoration methods in Ninigret Pond, and 2) restored reefs seeded with hatchery sourced vs. wild oyster lineages in Quonochontaug Pond. In Quonochontaug Pond, the hatchery-sourced line exhibited greater mortality than the wild lines. Restored reefs in both projects remained viable all four years post-restoration; however, low recruitment continues to limit the long-term sustainability of restored reefs in these Rhode Island systems. Natural mortality varied spatially within each coastal pond, ranging from 33–81\% per year. Across both experiments, oyster mortality increased with rising temperature, salinity, and disease prevalence. Our results suggest that utilizing active restoration with spat spawned from multiple sources, including wild populations, may improve the success of oyster restoration. Future habitat restoration efforts should consider the environmental variability associated with restoration sites and the source of restoration species during project planning.},

I examined phase synchrony in the fluctuations of age-0 winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) production among 19 southern New England (SNE), USA, coastal nurseries. From 1990 to 2004, nursery production was synchronized at scales up to {\textasciitilde}200 km based on spatial trends in cross-correlations of first-differenced age-0 abundance time series. However, sliding window analysis of 1975–2005 time series collected in six nurseries ≤55 km apart in northern SNE indicated that synchrony increased from low to high values in the early 1990s. Synchrony in production also increased among three nurseries ≤65 km apart in southern SNE from 1984 to 2004. Thus, interannual fluctuations in nursery production appeared to become synchronized at coarser spatial scales throughout SNE during the 1990s. This coarsening of the spatial scale of control of winter flounder nursery production was coincident with an increase in the frequency of springs with warm temperatures believed to negatively affect early life history processes. Spatial synchronization of winter flounder nursery ground production could destabilize the age-class structure and population dynamics in the region.},

An experiment was conducted with six 13-m3 land-based mesocosms (5 m deep) from February to April 1997 to address the impact of increased temperature (+3°C) on growth, survival, and trophic dynamics of winter flounder larvae. Objectives were to determine if warmer winter temperatures result in lower survival of winter flounder as a result of increased predator activity or if temperature-induced alterations in the food web result in greater food availability, perhaps leading to increased survival. Analyses of variance revealed significant (P {\textless} 0.05) or near-significant (P {\textless} 0.10) differences in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and biomass between warm and cool mesocosms. Winter flounder egg survival, percent hatch, time to hatch, and initial size were significantly greater in cool systems (P {\textless} 0.05). Mortality rates were lower in cool systems and significantly related to the abundance of active predators (P {\textless} 0.05). The cumulative impact of decreased survival of eggs and larvae in warm systems may partially explain the decline of winter flounder in Narragansett Bay, which has experienced elevated winter water temperatures in recent years.},

In laboratory experiments, shrimp feeding rates on flounder eggs were positively correlated with temperature and shrimp size. Immunological assays of shrimp stomach contents indicated that 7.2\% of shrimp collected from the Niantic River (Connecticut) had flounder eggs in their stomachs. Incidence of egg predation was highest in February (20\%) and decreased continuously into early April (1.2\%). In a deterministic model simulating predator-induced mortality of flounder eggs during a spawning season, shrimp consumed 0.4\%–49.7\% of the total flounder spawn. Variations in shrimp population abundance and size structure accounted for the greatest variability in egg mortality. Water temperature during the spawning season presumably alters the population dynamics of early-stage flounder. In a long-term survey, the number of yolk-sac flounder larvae in warm years (≥4.3 °C) was depressed at high egg densities, indicating strong compensatory processes that increased egg mortality and limited the abundance of larvae. Failure of flounder to produce strong year-classes of larvae during warm years, possibly resulting from altered trophic dynamics, may explain the inability of stocks to recover from previous overexploitation.},

Such data are vital for understanding the southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus stock, a species hypothesized to be adversely impacted by warming waters via increased temporal overlap between its early life stages and predators. To provide insight into winter flounder early life history dynamics and context for resiliency of the stock, we examined ichthyoplankton data collected from 2 monitoring programs within Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA: one spatially comprehensive dataset across the bay proper (2001-2008, 2016-2017), and the other a longer time series centered in one of the sub-estuaries of the bay (Mount Hope Bay, 1972-2017). By leveraging these datasets together, we conducted a spatiotemporal synthesis of early life stage winter flounder by evaluating changes in larval phenology, decadal coherence in larval spatial patterns, and correspondence between larvae and their subsequent life stage. We identified changes in larval phenology via earlier seasonal peaks in density through time. Results also indicated stable larval spatial patterns during a period of larval decline, as well as spatial coherence between larval and young-of-the-year stages. Using winter flounder as a model species, our results highlight the importance of high-resolution spatiotemporal ichthyoplankton sampling to identify changes in phenology and site fidelity for marine fishes.},

In such cases, detailed knowledge of species life history will be necessary to both restrict harvest and manage other environmental conditions, where possible, that impact survivorship. A current example of these challenges, the Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic Bight winter flounder stock remains in a persistently depleted state due to a combination of past harvest and the effects of climate change mediated through increased predation. To explore the recovery capacity of a subpopulation of this stock, a life-cycle model was fit to 29 year classes of stage-specific winter flounder data from surveys conducted in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island and used to project future subpopulation abundance. Supporting a prevailing hypothesis, the results indicated that environmental factors influencing juvenile mortality were largely responsible for inhibiting recovery. Furthermore, recovery of the subpopulation to past levels of abundance was determined to be unlikely even under optimistic future conditions resulting from aggressive management interventions. Taken together, the findings of this work pose important questions regarding the realism of assessing climate-challenged populations against biological reference points set under past environmental regimes and the degree to which harvest restrictions to promote recovery of such stocks should be allowed to limit warm-water fisheries thriving in a warming ocean.},

Thus, understanding the behavioural response to human-induced changes is crucial in the interplay between ecology, evolution, conservation and management. Yet the behavioural response to fishing activities has been largely ignored. We review studies contrasting how fish behaviour affects catch by passive (e.g., long lines, angling) versus active gears (e.g., trawls, seines). We show that fishing not only targets certain behaviours, but it leads to a multitrait response including behavioural, physiological and life-history traits with population, community and ecosystem consequences. Fisheries-driven change (plastic or evolutionary) of fish behaviour and its correlated traits could impact fish populations well beyond their survival per se, affecting predation risk, foraging behaviour, dispersal, parental care, etc., and hence numerous ecological issues including population dynamics and trophic cascades. In particular, we discuss implications of behavioural responses to fishing for fisheries management and population resilience. More research on these topics, however, is needed to draw general conclusions, and we suggest fruitful directions for future studies.},

Individuals primarily swam in the direction of initial orientation. No fish were oriented against the trawling direction. Fish in the center of the trawl mouth tended to swim along the bottom in the trawling direction. Only individuals that were stimulated to leave the bottom were caught.

	abstract = {For populations with a density‐dependent life history reproducing at discrete annual intervals, we analyze small or moderate fluctuations in population size around a stable equilibrium, which is applicable to many vertebrate populations. Using a life history having age at maturity α, with stochasticity and density dependence in adult recruitment and mortality, we derive a linearized autoregressive equation with time lags from 1 to α yr. Contrary to current interpretations, the coefficients corresponding to different time lags in the autoregressive dynamics are not simply measures of delayed density dependence but also depend on life‐history parameters. The theory indicates that the total density dependence in a life history, D, should be defined as the negative elasticity of population growth rate per generation with respect to change in population size, 𝐷=−𝜕ln⁡𝜆𝑇/𝜕ln⁡𝑁D=−∂ln⁡λT/∂ln⁡N, where λ is the asymptotic multiplicative growth rate per year, T is the generation time, and N is adult population size. The total density dependence in the life history, D, can be estimated from the sum of the autoregression coefficients. We estimate D in populations of seven vertebrate species for which life‐history studies and unusually long time series of complete population censuses are available. Estimates of D were statistically significant and large, on the order of 1 or higher, indicating strong density dependence in five of the seven species. We also show that life history can explain the qualitative features of population autocorrelation functions and power spectra and observations of increasing empirical variance in population size with increasing length of time series.},

	abstract = {Predicting animal population trajectories into the future has become a central exercise in both applied and fundamental ecology. Because demographic models classically assume population closure, they tend to provide inaccurate predictions when applied locally to interconnected subpopulations that are part of a larger metapopulation. Ideally, one should explicitly model dispersal among subpopulations, but in practice this is prevented by the difficulty of estimating dispersal rates in the wild. To forecast the local demography of connected subpopulations, we developed a new demographic model (hereafter, the two-scale model) that disentangles two processes occurring at different spatial scales. First, at the larger scale, a closed population model describes changes in metapopulation size over time. Second, total metapopulation size is redistributed among subpopulations, using time-varying proportionality parameters. This two-step approach ensures that the long-term growth of every subpopulation is constrained by the overall metapopulation growth rate. It implicitly accounts for the interconnectedness among subpopulations and avoids unrealistic trajectories. Using realistic simulations, we compared the performance of this new model with that of a classical closed population model at predicting subpopulations' trajectories over 30 years. While the classical model predicted future subpopulation sizes with an average bias of 30\% and produced predictive errors sometimes {\textgreater}500\%, the two-scale model showed very little bias ({\textless}3\%) and never produced predictive errors {\textgreater}20\%. We also applied both models to a real dataset on European shags (Gulosus aristotelis) breeding along the Atlantic coast of France. Again, the classical model predicted highly unrealistic growths, as large as a 200-fold increase over 30 years for some subpopulations. The two-scale model predicted very sensible growths, never larger than a threefold increase over the 30-year time horizon, which is more in accordance with this species' life history. This two-scale model provides an effective solution to forecast the local demography of connected subpopulations in the absence of data on dispersal rates. In this context, it is a better alternative than closed population models and a more parsimonious option than full-dispersal models. Because the only data required are simple counts, this model could be useful to many large-scale wildlife monitoring programs.},

This species exhibits intricate behaviors in spawning and migration that contribute to population complexity and resilience. These behaviors encompass full or partial philopatry to natal estuaries, the generation of multiple pulses of larval delivery, and partial migration. The patterns of genetic diversity within and among estuaries and cohorts presented here carry important implications in understanding the susceptibility to demographic shocks, even if the full extent of genetic diversity within and among winter flounder stocks on the US East Coast remains unresolved. Our findings reveal connectivity between estuaries in Long Island, New York, suggesting the potential for genetic rescue of depleted subpopulations. Family reconstruction and relatedness analysis indicate that split cohorts and migration contingents are not the result of genetically distinct lineages. We found no evidence for genetic structure separating these groups, and in some instances, we were able to detect closely related individuals that belonged to different migratory contingents or cohorts. Characterizing the spatial and behavioral organization of this species at the population level is crucial for comprehending its potential for recovery, not only in terms of biomass but also in reinstating the complex population structure that supports resilience. The search for generality in winter flounder spawning and migration behavior remains elusive, but perhaps the lack of generalities within this species is what has allowed it to persist in the face of decades of environmental and anthropogenic stressors.},

In U.S. waters, Winter Flounder are managed as three stocks: Gulf of Maine, southern New England–Mid-Atlantic Bight, and Georges Bank. Historically, it was believed that the spawning of inshore stocks occurs exclusively within natal estuaries. Based on the supposition of estuary-specific spawning, we hypothesized that Winter Flounder exhibit greater stock structure than predicted by the three-stock model and, in fact, that they exhibit genetic differentiation at the level of individual estuaries. We tested this hypothesis by conducting microsatellite DNA analysis at 12 loci and single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis at 4 loci on young-of-the year and adult Winter Flounder collected from 27 estuaries from Newfoundland to Delaware as well as from Georges Bank. We found highly significant coastwide genetic stock structure among Winter Flounder; however, there was little evidence of estuary-specific structure. Pooled collections from north and south of Cape Cod were genetically distinct, as were many individual collections compared between these two regions. However, there was little genetic heterogeneity among estuarine collections within either of these major geographic regions. The two Canadian collections from the Miramichi River and Newfoundland were genetically distinct from those in the Gulf of Maine. Our collection from Georges Bank was marginally distinct from the inshore collections from north and south of Cape Cod. Overall, our genetic results support the three-stock model used to manage Winter Flounder in U.S. waters and indicate the presence of at least two genetic stocks in Canadian waters (the Miramichi River in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Passamaquoddy Bay in the Bay of Fundy). Furthermore, our data suggest that the spawning of Winter Flounder in nearshore coastal waters is more extensive than previously thought or that homing is weaker, contributing to the absence of genetic differentiation among populations from proximal estuaries.},

Information on genetics, morphology, meristics, larval dispersal, life history traits, applied mark experiments and environmental signals was reviewed. Winter flounder in U.S. waters are currently managed as three separate units; Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine and Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic. Estuarine spawning, which likely plays an important role in reproductive isolation and population structure, appears to be obligate in southern New England, non-existent on Georges Bank and variable in the Gulf of Maine. Despite evidence for reproductively isolated estuarine groups, information from tagging, meristic analysis, and life history studies suggest extensive mixing, thereby supporting the current U.S. management regimen. In Canadian waters, winter flounder are managed as three units: western Scotian Shelf (NAFO Div. 4X), eastern Scotian Shelf (NAFO Div. 4VW), and the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (NAFO Div. 4T). Genetic analysis and parasite markers indicate that these Canadian management units are distinct. However, examination of inshore and offshore winter flounder within division 4X suggests little interchange occurs between these groups. Several separate stocks probably exist within the 4T management area as well. Stock assessment and fishery management would likely benefit from stock composition analysis of mixed-stock fisheries of both U.S. and Canadian fishery resources.},

Here, we characterize hard clam walking: active horizontal locomotion of adults (up to 118 mm shell length, SL) of the commercially important species, Mercenaria mercenaria, at the sediment surface—a behavior only briefly noted in the literature. We opportunistically observed walking over a 10-yr period, at 9 different sites in the Peconic Bays, New York, USA, and tested several hypotheses for the underlying cause of this behavior through quantitative field sampling and reproductive analyses. Hard clam walking was exhibited by males and females at equal frequency, predominantly during June/July and October, when clams were in peak spawning condition. Extensive walking behavior appears to be cued by a minimum population density; we suggest it may be mediated by unidentified pheromone(s), infaunal pressure waves and/or other unidentified factors. There was no directionality exhibited by walking clams, but individuals in an area of extensive walking were highly aggregated and walking clams were significantly more likely to move toward a member of the opposite sex. Thus, we conclude that hard clam walking serves to aggregate mature individuals prior to spawning, thereby facilitating greater fertilization success. In the process of investigating this behavior, however, we apparently oversampled one population and reduced clam densities below the estimated minimum threshold density and, in so doing, suppressed extensive walking for a period of {\textgreater}3 years running. This not only reinforces the importance of detailed field investigations of species biology and ecology, even for those that are considered to be well studied, but also highlights the need for greater awareness of the potential for research activities to affect focal species behavior.},

Overall, 94,250 valid detections were received. Winter flounder remained inshore, and 89\% of the total detections occurred between May and October when bottom water temperature exceeded 15°C. Residency in Shinnecock Bay was dependent on time of release and varied greatly from a few weeks to more than 6 months; total presence (number of days on which individual fish were detected within the bay) averaged 22.0 d (range = 1–132 d). Tracked winter flounder were classified as exhibiting three movement patterns: (1) inner bay movements (short term versus long term), (2) dispersal to offshore waters, and (3) connectivity to other inshore areas. The first two patterns were consistent with historical notions of spatially overlapping resident and migratory individuals, whereas fish that displayed the third pattern may have exhibited a larger home range. These results provide insight into winter flounder movements, residency, and stock structure in a coastal bay of Long Island and provide important information for management. The interaction of exploitation and divergent migration behaviors may be a factor contributing to the winter flounder's decline in Long Island bays; however, more work will be required to obtain a full understanding of the spatial behavior and stock structure of this species.},

	abstract = {Historic hunting has led to severe reductions of many marine mammal species across the globe. After hunting ceased, some populations have recovered to pre-exploitation levels and may have regained their prominent position as top predator in marine ecosystems. Also, the harbor seal population in the international Wadden Sea grew at an exponential rate following a ban on seal hunting in 1960s, and the current number 38,000 is close to the historic population size. Here we estimate the impact of the harbor seal predation on the fish community in the Wadden Sea and nearby coastal waters. Fish remains in fecal samples and published estimates on the seal's daily energy requirement were used to estimate prey selection and the magnitude of seal consumption. Estimates on prey abundance were derived from demersal fish surveys, and fish growth was estimated using a Dynamic Energy Budget model. GPS tracking provided information on where seals most likely caught their prey. Harbor seals hauling-out in the Dutch Wadden Sea fed predominantly on demersal fish, for example, flatfish species (flounder, sole, plaice, dab), but also on sandeel, cod, and whiting. Although harbor seals acquire the majority of prey further offshore in the adjacent North Sea, and only spend 14\% of their diving time in the Wadden Sea, seal predation was still estimated to cause an average annual mortality of 43\% of the remaining fish in the Wadden Sea and 60\% in the nearby shallow coastal waters ({\textless}20 m). There were however large sources of uncertainty in the estimated impact of seals on fish, including the migration of fish between the North Sea and Wadden Sea, and catchability estimates of the fish survey sampling gear, particularly for sandeel and other pelagic fish species. Our estimate suggested a considerable top-down pressure by harbor seals on demersal fish. However, predation by seals may also alleviate density-dependent competition between the remaining fish, allowing for increased fish growth, and partly compensating for the reduction in fish numbers. This study shows that recovering coastal marine mammal populations could become an important component in the functioning of shallow coastal ecosystems.},

Demersal fish, striped searobin Prionotus evolans and summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus, were more important predators of winter flounder than pelagic fish (Pomatomus saltatrix, Cynoscion regalis, Morone saxatilis) based on diet analysis of 4 yr of gill (1998 and 1999) and trammel net (2001 and 2002) fish collections. From April through June newly settled winter flounder {\textless}20 mm standard length (SL) were eaten by striped searobin that were common in habitats with salinities ≥ 20‰. Fish {\textgreater}20 mm standard length (SL) were consumed by summer flounder in shallow habitats in June and July. In May and June tethering experiments, Age-0 winter flounder predation risk was high in habitats with salinities {\textgreater}19‰ and temperatures {\textgreater}20°C. In 3 yr, salinities were {\textless}20‰ in the upstream reach of estuary which probably served as a predator refuge for settling flounder. During 2002, however, historically low freshwater discharge associated with a spring drought produced high salinities ≥20‰ in upstream habitats where searobins ate large numbers of settling winter flounder and predation risk was high. These results suggest that the volume of estuarine habitat suitable for early juvenile flounder survivorship is determined, in part, by predator and prey responses to spatially dynamic physico-chemical gradients. Because gradient dynamics are controlled by climate forcing, climate variation may cause nursery habitat volumes to contract or expand resulting in variation in the local production of Age-0 recruits.},

study examined size-dependent predation on post-settlement winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus by the sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa, and the interactive effects of flounder density and water temperature on the predator-prey
interaction. Shrimp were visually observed foraging on flounder, and the major elements of the Œpredation sequence¹ were quantified, from which the susceptibility and gross vulnerability of flounder were estimated. Flounder susceptibility generally
decreased with increasing fish size until a complete refuge from shrimp predation was attained at sizes {\textgreater}25 mm total length (TL). The gross vulnerability of flounder to shrimp predation was dome-shaped when analyzed graphically with respect to prey
size. At the extremes of the vulnerability response curve, small flounder (8 to 12 mm TL) benefited from a decreased rate of encounters with shrimp predators, whereas large flounder (18 to 22 mm TL) profited from superior escape abilities and prolonged
predator handling time once attacked and captured. Conversely, intermediate-sized flounder (13 to 17 mm TL) suffered the highest rates of mortality, and this was accentuated with increasing temperature and decreasing flounder density. Intermediate-sized
flounder (17 mm TL) were the most energetically profitable for shrimp. Below this size, net energy intake of shrimp decreased because of the lower caloric content of smaller flounder. Above this size, the increased metabolic demands associated with
foraging on large flounder resulted in a decrease in shrimp net-energy gain. Moreover, shrimp feeding on low densities of flounder suffered a net loss in energy intake, thus possibly explaining the observed density-dependent predation of crangonid species
feeding on flatfish. Results from this study challenge the applicability of the bigger-is-better hypothesis to this specific predator-prey interaction.},

Although a key hypothesis is that the diversity of functional traits determines ecosystem functioning, we do not know how much trait diversity is needed to maintain multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (multifunctionality). Here, we uncovered a scaling relationship between the abundance distribution of two key plant functional traits (specific leaf area, maximum plant height) and multifunctionality in 124 dryland plant communities spread over all continents except Antarctica. For each trait, we found a strong empirical relationship between the skewness and the kurtosis of the trait distributions that cannot be explained by chance. This relationship predicted a strikingly high trait diversity within dryland plant communities, which was associated with a local maximization of multifunctionality. Skewness and kurtosis had a much stronger impact on multifunctionality than other important multifunctionality drivers such as species richness and aridity. The scaling relationship identified here quantifies how much trait diversity is required to maximize multifunctionality locally. Trait distributions can be used to predict the functional consequences of biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems.},

flesus specimens had developed such tags in their otoliths. In contrast, tags were rarely found in sole Solea solea. Many North Sea plaice Pleuronectes platessa from subpopulations inhabiting areas with extended tidal flats had
pronounced hyaline zones, but lacked these tags along sandy beaches without tidal flats. In long bights with low water exchange in the German Wadden Sea and in the inner parts of the Westerschelde, multiple hyaline zones were frequently found in the
otoliths of 0-group plaice. In previous investigations, it had been possible to experimentally induce early hyaline zones surrounding the nucleus of plaice otoliths by UV-B radiation, high temperature, or starvation treatment. In this study, strong
indications are presented that UV-B mediated oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) in coastal areas, particularly in tidal pools during the pool-dwelling period of the 3 species, was the most important mechanism in the formation of the early hyaline zones
in both the field and the laboratory. The occurrence or lack of hyaline zones surrounding the nucleus can be explained by the different patterns in settlement of the 3 species, by the prevailing weather conditions during and after settlement, and by
differences in the hydrographic conditions. In the Dutch Wadden Sea, the lack of such early hyaline zones can be attributed to the lower tidal range and the weather conditions during the period of settlement. Due to their highly rheotactic behaviour,
early flounder postlarvae almost exclusively inhabit tidal pools directly at the shoreline. Until the tide comes in, flounder may also be exposed to radiation much longer than plaice, since plaice are much more widespread over the tidal flats, depending
on the prevailing tidal regime. For sole, tidal pools are less important habitats as compared to plaice and flounder. The distinct multiple hyaline zones in 0-group plaice otoliths are most likely also linked to oxidative stress. Other possible factors
like diseases and injuries during the sorting out of by-catch on shrimp vessels are discussed.},

	abstract = {Turbidity is an important habitat component in estuaries for many fishes and affects a range of other ecological functions. Decadal timescale declines in turbidity have been observed in the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary), with the declines generally attributed to a reduction in sediment supply to the Estuary and changes to the erodible sediment pool in the Estuary. However, we analyzed hourly wind data from 1995 through 2015 and found statistically significant declines of 13 to 48\% in wind speed around the Estuary. This study applied a 3-D hydrodynamic, wave, and sediment transport model to evaluate the effects of the observed decrease in wind speed on turbidity in the Estuary. The reduction in wind speed over the past 20 years was predicted to result in a decrease in turbidity of 14 to 55\% in Suisun Bay from October through January. These results highlight that the observed declines in both wind speed and sediment supply over the past 20 years have resulted in reduced turbidity in the San Francisco Estuary from October through January. This decline in turbidity in Suisun Bay potentially has negative effects on habitat for fish like the endangered Delta Smelt which are more commonly caught in relatively turbid water.},

Development and nutrient input are causing turbidity to increase in many coastal areas. Using an 18 yr data set from Aransas and San Antonio Bays in Texas, we found fish abundance (Sciaenops ocellatus, Pogonias cromis, Archosargus probatocephalus) to be highest in low turbidity ({\textless} 30 nephelometric turbidity units [NTU]; p {\textless} 0.01), while crab (Callinectes sapidus) abundance was highest in high turbidity ({\textgreater} 30 NTU; p {\textless} 0.05). In field studies, mud crabs (Panopeus spp.), an important intermediate predator on oyster reefs that are not targeted in the 18 yr data set, were more abundant on oyster reefs in St. Charles Bay, Texas, when turbidity exceeded 30 NTU (p = 0.03). Fish predation on tethered Panopeus herbstii was greatest when turbidity was low ({\textless} 30 NTU, p {\textless} 0.05), but predation by crabs (p = 0.003) and overall predation (p = 0.02) were greatest in high turbidity ({\textgreater} 30 NTU). Predation on oyster spat was not different between low- and high-turbidity sites (p = 0.64). However, oysters devoted more resources to shell growth (p {\textless} 0.01) at a cost of less somatic growth and fecundity, a reaction known to occur in response to crab predators. Elevated turbidity can alter trophic interactions in estuaries by altering species composition and trophic interactions, leading to an increase in crab abundance, which can alter predation rates as well as growth in juvenile oysters.},

Freshwater flow impacts habitat availability, trophic interactions, and fishers’ harvesting behavior in estuarine and coastal systems. Seasonal and interannual variation in freshwater flow influences the distribution and abundance of fish and invertebrates through changes in growth, survival, and recruitment. Episodic flood and drought events have pronounced impacts on fisheries production due to rapid changes in physicochemical conditions modifying species richness and diversity. Many documented reductions in fisheries production have been attributed to river regulation modifying natural variation in freshwater flow. Protecting natural flow regimes is likely to be an effective management strategy to maintain the production of estuarine and coastal fisheries. Understanding the freshwater requirements of estuarine and coastal fisheries will become increasingly important as climate change modifies the hydrological cycle and as human population growth increases demand for water resources. One major challenge for scientists seeking to explore relationships between freshwater flow and fisheries production is to understand how variable flows influence resource availability, fishing activity, and the economic performance of commercial fisheries in estuarine and coastal systems.},

Between 2010 and 2019, continuous weekly sampling with fyke nets was carried out to assess the dynamics of fish assemblages in the estuary. In addition, temperature and precipitation data were obtained from satellite information to assess the relationship between climatic variables and fish composition, structure, and diversity. Fish populations changed significantly over time, becoming less diverse and largely dominated by a few, mostly invasive species (e.g., carp, goldfish, pumpkinseed, and tench), while the abundance of most native species declined over the years (e.g., panjorca, stickleback, and shad). High temperatures and low precipitation negatively affected native species, while the invasive species benefited from increased temperatures and extreme weather events (droughts and floods).},

A shortcoming of black box supervised learning models (e.g. complex trees, neural networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbours, local kernel-weighted methods and support vector regression) in this regard is their lack of interpretability or transparency. Partial dependence plots, which are the most popular approach for visualizing the effects of the predictors with black box supervised learning models, can produce erroneous results if the predictors are strongly correlated, because they require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the training data. As an alternative to partial dependence plots, we present a new visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects plots, which do not require this unreliable extrapolation with correlated predictors. Moreover, accumulated local effects plots are far less computationally expensive than partial dependence plots. We also provide an R package ALEPlot as supplementary material to implement our proposed method.},

However, models developed for fish often only address physical habitat characteristics, thus omitting potentially important biotic factors. Therefore, we assessed the impact of biotic variables on fish habitat preferences in four selected stretches of the upper Cabriel River (E Spain). The occurrence of Squalius pyrenaicus and Luciobarbus guiraonis was related to environmental variables describing biotic interactions (inferred by relationships among fish abundances) and channel hydro-morphological characteristics. Random Forests (RF) models were trained and then validated using independent datasets. To build RF models, the conditional variable importance was used together with the model improvement ratio technique. The procedure showed effectiveness in identifying a parsimonious set of not correlated variables, which minimize noise and improve model performance in both training and validation phases. Water depth, channel width, fine substrate and water-surface gradient were selected as most important habitat variables for both fish. Results showed clear habitat overlapping between fish species and suggest that competition is not a strong factor in the study area.},

	abstract = {The timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms have changed markedly in Narragansett Bay, RI (USA) over the last half century. The traditional winter–spring bloom has decreased or, in many years, disappeared. Relatively short, often intense, diatom blooms have become common in spring, summer, and fall replacing the summer flagellate blooms of the past. The annual and summer mean abundance (cell counts) and biomass (chl a) of phytoplankton appear to have decreased based on almost 50 years of biweekly monitoring by others at a mid bay station. These changes have been related to warming of the water, especially during winter, and to increased cloudiness. A significant decline in the winter wind speed may also have played a role. The changes in the phenology of the phytoplankton and the oligotrophication of the bay appear to have decreased greatly the quantity and (perhaps) quality of the organic matter being deposited on the bottom of the bay. This decline has resulted in a very much reduced benthic metabolism as reflected in oxygen uptake, nutrient regeneration, and the magnitude and direction of the net flux of N2 gas. Based on many decades of standard weekly trawls carried out by the Graduate School of Oceanography, the winter biomass of bottom feeding epibenthic animals has also declined sharply at the mid bay station. After decades of relatively constant anthropogenic nitrogen loading (and declining phosphorus loading), the fertilization of the bay will soon be reduced during May–October due to implementation of advanced wastewater treatment. This is intended to produce an oligotrophication of the urban Providence River estuary and the Upper Bay. The anticipated decline in the productivity of the upper bay region will probably decrease summer hypoxia in that area. However, it may have unanticipated consequences for secondary production in the mid and lower bay where climate-induced oligotrophication has already much weakened the historically strong benthic–pelagic coupling.},

Available data sets describing predators of both age‐0 and adult Winter Flounder, fecal coliform measurements, water temperature, and commercial and recreational harvest were run in a correlative analysis with age‐0 and adult Winter Flounder.Despite decreases in fishing mortality within the pond, there has been no recovery within the Point Judith Pond subpopulation—a shared response across the stock unit. Although it is possible that an increase in predators of eggs, age‐0 Winter Flounder, and spawning adults may be hindering the recovery of this subpopulation, other characteristics, such as water quality, habitat degradation, and prey availability, may also be important contributing factors. The survival rates of age‐0 Winter Flounder through their first summer appear to have been relatively unchanged over the course of the research, but there has been a contraction in both the spawning period and the maximum size of adult female Winter Flounder in the study area.By the time a fishing moratorium was implemented in Point Judith Pond, Winter Flounder abundance was already below time series historic minimums. With fishing pressure seemingly no longer regulating population size, other management strategies must be developed to address natural mortality and habitat degradation.Impact statementDespite two decades of monitoring multiple life stages of a Winter Flounder subpopulation within a single coastal lagoon under limited fishing pressure, identification of the biotic and abiotic bottlenecks to population recovery remains elusive.},

Flounders enter the intertidal zone with the rising tide. Peak movement occurs 2–2.5 hr after low tide. Movement generally falls off 3.5 hr after tide begins to rise. Flounders occupy the area for 6–8 hr and then surge back to the sublittoral 2.5–0.5 hr before the next low tide. Small flounders move with the same synchrony as large flounders, but tend to make short movements up and down the beach, with net movement away from shore while tide is falling. Large flounders are more strictly directional. Movements of eight species that occurred with the flounder are compared. Because of the scale of the flounder movement, and because of published observations of pleuronectids feeding in the intertidal zone, it is proposed that the intertidal zone is a major feeding area for northern populations of winter flounder. Actions that interfere with productivity in the intertidal zone (oil pollution, tidal impoundments) are likely to reduce productivity of flounder populations.},

To determine if winter flounder use temperature refuge during seasonally cold and warm periods, we evaluated internal body temperature relative to water temperature, utilizing acoustic telemetry in a southern New England estuary. The internal body temperature of individuals commonly exceeded that of ambient water during the winter, and conversely, remained lower than ambient water during the summer. During a 3 mo trial, Kalman filter time series analysis indicated that internal body temperatures of winter flounder exhibited greater similarity to sediment temperature recorded at depths of 3, 6 and 9 cm compared to water temperature, indicating that winter flounder use burial as a strategy for thermoregulation.

The second general relationship is that among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. Again this pattern holds over a variety of spatial scales from local regions to entire geographic ranges. These empirical patterns have already been reported in the literature, but their generality is demonstrated by analysis of additional data for diverse kinds of organisms. A single general theory accounts for these observations and follows logically from three assumptions. First, the abundance and distribution of each species are limited by the combination of physical and biotic environmental variables that determines the multidimensional niche. Second, spatial variation in these environmental variables is somewhat stochastic but autocorrelated, so that nearby sites tend to have more similar environmental conditions than more distant ones. Third, closely related, ecologically similar species differ in no more than a very few niche dimensions. A more formal model can be developed that predicts that under these assumptions the distribution of population density over space should approximate a normal probability density distribution. Most exceptions to this predicted pattern can be explained as cases in which assumptions of the model are clearly violated. This paper represents an example of a statistical approach that should be useful for investigating complex ecological systems comprised of many components, such as species of many individuals or communities of many species. The general relationships between abundance and distribution developed here eventually should contribute to our understanding of the biogeography, population genetics, and evolution of species as well as the ecological attributes of populations and communities.},

	abstract = {Predicting distribution has become a fundamental component in conservation or wildlife management. Modelling is increasingly used to identify important areas (e.g., those areas more suitable for a species or more likely to hold high densities). Models often use presence/absence rather than abundance data, partly because measuring abundance is more difficult than measuring presence. We aimed to test if the relationship between occurrence models and predicted abundance varied for two sibling species that differ in the level of nest aggregation: the Montagu’s harrier (a semi-colonial raptor species) and the hen harrier (more territorial). We modelled presence/absence distribution and the number of pairs of each species with GLM and large-scale environmental variables, and compared predicted results of both sets of models. In the case of the hen harrier, predictions of the presence/absence model reliably identified areas with highest densities for the species. In contrast, in the Montagu’s harrier, there were large apparently favourable areas where predicted breeding density was low. Our results indicate that breeding system is likely to shape the relationship between presence/absence vs density models. In species that are randomly or evenly spaced, even if spatial variations in density occur, using results of presence/absence models is likely to be adequate for population monitoring. In contrast, in the case of semi-colonial species, it is necessary to take into account both occurrence and abundance models to identify areas of conservation importance or concern. There are a considerable number of birds which are semi-colonial or aggregated species, thus these results could have general implications.},

The fish were held in the laboratory for 1 year to study tag retention and the effect of the various tag types on growth and survival. Tag retention was highest for spaghetti tags, with seven of nine tags still being attached after 1 year. Four of nine operculum danglers remained after 1 year, three of nine Petersen discs, and zero of nine streamers. For those fish that still had tags after 1 year there was no difference by tag type in growth, length or weight. There was no tagging mortality. Based on this experiment and their ease of application, we conclude that spaghetti tags would provide the best results in field studies of juvenile flatfish.},

The coefficients are converted using Fisher's z-transformation with standard errors (N − 3)−1/2. The two transformed values are then compared using a standard normal procedure. When data are not bivariate normal, Spearman's correlation coefficient rho is often used as the index of correlation. Comparison of two Spearman rhos is not as well documented. Three approaches were investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. Treating the Spearman coefficients as though they were Pearson coefficients and using the standard Fisher's z-transformation and subsequent comparison was more robust with respect to Type I error than either ignoring the nonnormality and computing Pearson coefficients or converting the Spearman coefficients to Pearson equivalents prior to transformation.},

	abstract = {Random forest (RF) modeling has emerged as an important statistical learning method in ecology due to its exceptional predictive performance. However, for large and complex ecological data sets, there is limited guidance on variable selection methods for RF modeling. Typically, either a preselected set of predictor variables are used or stepwise procedures are employed which iteratively remove variables according to their importance measures. This paper investigates the application of variable selection methods to RF models for predicting probable biological stream condition. Our motivating data set consists of the good/poor condition of n = 1365 stream survey sites from the 2008/2009 National Rivers and Stream Assessment, and a large set (p = 212) of landscape features from the StreamCat data set as potential predictors. We compare two types of RF models: a full variable set model with all 212 predictors and a reduced variable set model selected using a backward elimination approach. We assess model accuracy using RF’s internal out-of-bag estimate, and a cross-validation procedure with validation folds external to the variable selection process. We also assess the stability of the spatial predictions generated by the RF models to changes in the number of predictors and argue that model selection needs to consider both accuracy and stability. The results suggest that RF modeling is robust to the inclusion of many variables of moderate to low importance. We found no substantial improvement in cross-validated accuracy as a result of variable reduction. Moreover, the backward elimination procedure tended to select too few variables and exhibited numerous issues such as upwardly biased out-of-bag accuracy estimates and instabilities in the spatial predictions. We use simulations to further support and generalize results from the analysis of real data. A main purpose of this work is to elucidate issues of model selection bias and instability to ecologists interested in using RF to develop predictive models with large environmental data sets.},

	abstract = {Indices of abundance based on fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) are important components of many stock assessments, particularly when fishery-independent surveys are unavailable. Standardizing CPUE to develop indices that better reflect the relative abundance requires the analyst to make numerous decisions, which are influenced by factors that include the biology of the study species, the structure of the fishery of interest, the nature of the available data, and the objectives of the analysis such as how standardized data will be used in a subsequent assessment model. Alternative choices can substantially change the index, and hence stock assessment outcomes and management decisions. To guide decisions, we provide advice on good practices in 16 areas, focusing on decision points: fishery definitions, exploring and preparing data, misreporting, data aggregation, density and catchability covariates, environmental variables, combining CPUE and survey data, analysis tools, spatial considerations, setting up and predicting from the model, uncertainty estimation, error distributions, model diagnostics, model selection, multispecies targeting, and using CPUE in stock assessments. Often the most influential outcome of exploring and analysing catch and effort data is that analysts better understand the population and the fishery, thereby improving the stock assessment.},
